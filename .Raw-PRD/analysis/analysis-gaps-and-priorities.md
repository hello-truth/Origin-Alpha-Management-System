- Store module enabled
- Database structure enhanced
- File upload capability (500MB)

⚠️ **Pending**:
- WhatsApp proxy server setup
- Backup automation to bck.caldronflex.com.np
- Performance optimization for 30 concurrent users

## Immediate Priorities

### Priority 1: Complete Sprint 3 Tasks
**Timeline**: 2 weeks (immediate start)
**Critical Path**: These features block production workflow

### Priority 2: WhatsApp Integration
**Timeline**: Following Sprint 3
**Dependency**: Customer communication system

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **Sprint 3 Delay**: Already behind schedule (should have completed Mar 9)

2. **Database Design**: Well-structured schema
3. **Security**: Built-in Laravel security
