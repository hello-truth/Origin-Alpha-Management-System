## 10. Conclusion

The analysis confirms that ErpGo Saas provides a solid foundation with approximately **60% code reusability** for core business modules. However, printing-specific features require custom development. The recommended approach is:

1. **Leverage ErpGo** for authentication, CRM, and billing
2. **Customize** order and product management
3. **Build custom** printing workflow and file processing
4. **Modernize** frontend with React
5. **Implement** comprehensive API layer

This hybrid approach balances speed of development with specific business requirements, resulting in a robust, scalable solution for Caldron Flex's printing business needs.
